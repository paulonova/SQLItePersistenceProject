# SQLItePersistenceProject

By persisting your data, you can provide users with a more seamless experience with your app—even when they go offline. 
If you're an Android app developer, you have many data persistence options to choose from. 

To begin, I reviews using the de facto data persistence solution available on Android: SQLite. 
I takes it through basic SQLite concepts—such as how to create a database wrapper and insert data 
into a table—as well as a few more advanced topics. Next, I cover working with Cupboard, an open-source 
project dedicated to simplifying your SQLite interactions. To wrap up, I dive into working with Realm, 
an object database solution designed with mobile devices in mind. I will establish relationships between database tables,
creating and running queries, as well as performing data migrations.

Topics include:
* Overview of SQLite
* Defining a database table's schema
* Exploring SQLite create table syntax
* Executing create table statements
* Inserting data with a foreign key relation
* Inspecting the database using a terminal
* Updating and deleting records
* Working with Cupboard
* Working with Realm
